# Timers Crafters Application

Welcome to the Timers Crafters Application! This project allows users to set and manage multiple timers simultaneously. Each timer runs independently and displays the remaining time. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the `setInterval()` function to manage timer countdowns. In this README, we'll provide an overview of the project and guide you on how to use and customize it.

Before diving into the details, you can check out a live demo of the Multi-Timer Application here: [Demo Link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/luisrpavanelli/Timers-Crafters/blob/main/index.html)

## Features

- **Multiple Timers**: Create and manage multiple timers, each running independently.

- **Timer Properties**: Each timer object includes essential properties such as current time remaining, original time set, and the current timer state (running or paused).

- **Intuitive User Interface**: The application provides an easy-to-use interface for adding, starting, pausing, and resetting timers.

- **Customizable Styling**: You can customize the appearance of the timers using the included CSS styles or by modifying the CSS to fit your project's design.
